This repository contains the codes to generate the videos of my YouTube channel [Varniex](https://youtube.com/@Varniex)

The videos are animated using Grant Sanderson's ([3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)) library [ManimGL](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) `v 1.7.1`

> **Note**: There are actually three versions of Manim:
>
> 1. Manim OpenGL ([ManimGL](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)): This version is maintained by 3Blue1Brown.
> 2. [ManimCE](https://manim.community) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)): This version is community maintained. It is better documented for beginners especially. If you are a newbie, I'd suggest you to go with this.
> 3. [Manim Cairo](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/tree/cairo-backend): This is **deprecated** now.
>
> _All of these versions are very different from each other. Please follow the guidelines of the respective version of Manim for its installation and tutorials._

## Support

Writing and animating (and coding) ideas are tough. How to present them in a simpler way possible consumes energy and time.

If you liked my videos, you can share them to someone you think these videos might be useful. You can also subscribe to my YouTube Channel [Varniex](https://www.youtube.com/@Varniex), so that next time I upload a new video, you'll get notified. It is free to you, but it helps me a lot.
